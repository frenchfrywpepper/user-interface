user-interface
==============

Women’s P2P Network has been collaborating with a team of women computer science students in 
Haiti to create a voice-based messaging system that will enable our partner organization, 
Fonkoze to contact it’s 55,000 members (illiterate market women) who are distributed throughout 
the country. Currently, the only way to reach them is by motorcycle.

Ultimately, they system will serve as a basis for messaging systems in other countries (such as 
gender-based violence reporting and a toolkit for women’s political participation).

The system requires two phases:

1)	Registration Phase 
-	User Interface (2013 Open Source Day Project) Women must call 
in and use an ivr system to register their phone number and reregister each time they change their number. 
-	Storing and treating the data (Written by Haiti Students using Java https://github.com/womensp2p/ivr-original) 
-	Tying the system to Fonkoze’s database (Future)

2) Messaging Phase 
1.	Fonkoze is able to send voice messages to clients (Written using Twilio, may be rewritten using VoiceXML) https://github.com/womensp2p/text-to-call-webapp 
2.	Women are able to message groups of other women or their local radio station. (Not yet written)
